# WALRUS OPERATOR -> It allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression, rather than as a separate statement.

# Example 1: Using the walrus operator to assign a value within an if/else statement

# TYPES DEFINITIONS -> In this hints are added using the colon (:) syntax for variables and the -> syntax for function return types.

# ADVANCED TYPE HINTS -> Python supports advanced type hints that allow for more complex data structures and types.

# MATCH CASE -> provides a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a single variable or expression

def designationwithsalary(designation: str, salary: int):
    match designation: # we can't write salary: int here, as match case doesn't support type hints and also against a single string, which wonâ€™t work correctly

# DICTIONARY MERGE & UPDATE OPERATORS -> It is a new operators, | and |= allow for merging and updating dictionaries.

# EXCEPTION HANDLING -> It is the code that handles the exception is written in the except clause. It can be handled using a try statement.

try:

# RAISING EXCEPTIONS -> we can raise exceptions using the raise statement. This is useful when we want to enforce certain conditions in our code.

# TRY WITH ELSE -> It is used to execute a block of code if no exceptions are raised in the try block.
